# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. The dataset analyzed took a look at the US Apparel product reviews. I used Pandas to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members. 

## Results
Vine Program (Paid Reviews)
* There were a total of 33 reviews for the paid vine program 
* only 15 of those reviews were 5-star reviews 
* Therefore 46% of the total reviews consisted of 5-star reviews

Unpaid Reviews
* There were a total of 45,388 reviews for the paid vine program 
* Only 23,733 of those reviews were 5-star reviews 
* Therefore 52.3% of the total reviews consisted of 5-star reviews

## Summary 
The total number for unpaid reviews were much substantially higher. The paid reviews only accounted for 0.07% of the grand total of reviews. The unpaid reviews also had a higher 5-start rating percentage when compared to the paid vine reviews.  This proves that the lack of an incentive to leave a review does not cause a bias towards leaving a favorable review. Therefore, the paid vine program is not a value add and wonâ€™t be necessary to continue to the program in the future.
